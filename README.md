# Price-prediction-engine

We are helping our customers purchase XoX (a made-up product) from various makers. Price is one of the most important things customer cares about. We need to estimate the price of a XoX before we recommend it to our customers. 

We would like to build a machine learning model to accurately predict the price for a future purchase and provide insights to explain the predicted price to our customers. 

We will preprocess, clean, analyze and visualized the provided data. 

We will build a machine learning model to help customer determine the price for a purchase. 

We will discuss feature importance and metrics
